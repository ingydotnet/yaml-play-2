<h1 id="yaml-development-playgrounds">YAML Development Playgrounds</h1>

<p>Welcome to the playground area.
Here you’ll find live demos of activity related to ongoing YAML language
development.</p>

<p>When you change values in the playgrounds, your changes are saved into the URL.
You can share your sessions with others just by sending them the URL.
This is a useful when reporting problems you come across.</p>

<h2 id="playgrounds">Playgrounds</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="parser">YAML Parsers</a></p>

    <p>Compare YAML parsers in several programming languages.
The non-JavaScript parsers require you to run a local Docker sandbox
container.
See below for details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="javascript">JavaScript</a></p>

    <p>This playground compares only the JavaScript loaders.</p>

  This is a playground that we use mostly for developing the playground
  functionality itself.

<h2 id="setting-up-a-local-sandbox">Setting up a Local Sandbox</h2>

<p>YAML frameworks are implemented in many programming languages.
We want to be able to let you try all of them.
This means we need a backend server to run the code.</p>

<p>This, of course, has lots of security and hosting concerns.</p>

<p>The way we get around all that is to have you host the backend yourself!
Docker makes this trivial to do, and also assures that the only evil you can do
is to your own machine. :)</p>

<p>The playground will inform you when you need to run Docker, but we’ll cover it
here.</p>

<p>Assuming you have <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker installed</a>, just
run this command from a terminal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker run --rm -d -p 31337:31337 yamlio/yaml-play-sandbox:0.1.11-C https
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will start a local YAML Playground sandbox server, and your playgrounds
will be able to work with them.</p>

<h3 id="browser-needs">Browser Needs</h3>

<p>The sandbox server you just started uses Python Flask with a self-signed
certificate.
You’ll need to open <a href="https://0.0.0.0:31337">https://0.0.0.0:31337</a> and accept the certificate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You should see a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Success!</code> message on the page if it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you restart the sandbox server, some browsers will need you to accept the
certificate again.
Here are some ways to prevent having to re-accept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safari
    <ul>
      <li>No problem. Just works.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Google Chrome (also works for Chromium)
    <ul>
      <li>Enable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Firefox
    <ul>
      <li>Open the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">about:config</code> URL</li>
      <li>Search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy</code> in the “Search preference
name” box</li>
      <li>Change value from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code></li>
      <li>Restart Firefox</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other Browsers
    <ul>
      <li>We haven’t tested them yet.</li>
      <li>Feel free to do it yourself and report back
<a href="https://github.com/yaml/yaml-play/issues">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll keep looking for ways to make this simpler.
If you have ideas, let us know!</p>

<p><strong>To use the Playgound without running Docker commands or appeasing your
browser, keep reading!</strong></p>

<h2 id="run-playground-locally">Run Playground Locally</h2>

<p>If you are interested in toying around with the playground code yourself, it is
easy to make changes and run the server locally.
This might be useful if you want to submit a pull request to fix a bug or add a
feature.</p>

<p>To run this site locally all you need to do is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git clone https://github.com/yaml/yaml-play
$ cd yaml-play
$ make serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your local playground will be served at <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/main/">http://0.0.0.0:4000/main/</a>.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make serve</code> command will automatically start the right docker container
for you.
It will also kill that container when you kill the local server (ctl-C).</p>

<p>Using the playground this way also requires no browser fiddling.</p>
